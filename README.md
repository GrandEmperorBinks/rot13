# rot13
 
CSP1150 Project
projectassignment is a 'ROT13' encryption/decryption program, which utilises the ROT13 special case of a ceaser cypher to encrypt and decrypt text.
It only encodes/decodes letters and ignores whitespaces and any other symbol. This encryption is not considered to actually be secure, and should not be used to store sensitive information.
Output of the program is stored in 'data.txt', a file that will be created automatically if it is not already present.
